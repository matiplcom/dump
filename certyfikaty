you can refresh the certificates on Debian by running the command update-ca-certificates as root. This command updates the directory /etc/ssl/certs to hold SSL certificates and generates ca-certificates.crt, a concatenated single-file list of certificates. It reads the file /etc/ca-certificates.conf, which contains the pathnames of the CA certificates that should be trusted. You can also use the -f option to force a fresh update and remove any symlinks in /etc/ssl/certs directory. For more details, you can see the manpage of update-ca-certificates or visit this website3
